# using the sdcard boad
The 'drivers' and CLI is now on ROM
- g 2000

Programs can:
- save a memory block to file. require setting the filename, start address and file lenght at proper memory address
- load to file to a memory block. require setting the filename, start address and geting file lenght at proper memory address

There are functions available to do both tasks:

int ztgsdcard_load(char *s, int start);
void ztgsdcard_save(char *s, int start, int len);

# TODO - Schematics

# ISSUES:
- sdcards with 32G doesnt work with the used SD library. It seems that the STM32 firmware must rebuid around SDfat.
- the if status for each operation should be remodeled (may be when add new commands)
- save again, with same filename, append the all file. (stm32 files are opened in append mode)
- slow (it was not made to be quick). There is a delay time bettewn operations that may be reduced.
- the CLI messages appear in the user programs
- the stm32 board power... !
- if sd if bad status inside the user programs, it needs to be handled inside the program. Now we need to issue "o 40 f" on monitor

# List
- add mkdir command
- add rmdir command 
- add rn command (rename)
- add copy command
- add cd command, and sense of current directory
- open file streams in C sense
